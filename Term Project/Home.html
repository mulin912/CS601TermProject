        <p>Welcome to my personal site, Everyone! My name is Lin Mu, and I currently work full-time as a Sales Program Manager at a software company based in San Francisco, California. </p>
        <p>
          In addition to my professional career, I am currently a part-time student, pursuing a Master's degree in software development at Boston University's MET College. This will be my second Master's degree, and I anticipate graduating in 2024. I previously obtained an MBA from CalState East Bay several years ago.
        </p>
        <p>Over the past a few years, I have been working in sales and related roles. Since my current and previous employers are tech-related companies, I have had the opportunity to collaborate with engineers on various projects. I have discovered a strong interest in reviewing code and participating in workflow design processes. This passion has led me to apply for a second master's degree at BU to further enhance my programming skills. I hope to become a Software Developer upon graduating from BU!</p>
